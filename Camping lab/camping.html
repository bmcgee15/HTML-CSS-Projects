		<h1>Camping</h1>
		
		<p>Camping is an outdoor recreational activity. The participants (known as campers) leave urban areas, their home region, or civilization and enjoy nature while spending one or several nights outdoors, usually at a campsite. Camping may involve the use of a tent, caravan, motorhome, cabin, a primitive structure, or no shelter at all. In many parts of the world, camping refers exclusively to the use of tents or similar portable structures. Camping as a recreational activity became popular in the early 20th century. Campers frequent national or state parks, other publicly owned natural areas, and privately owned campgrounds. Camping is a key part of many youth organizations around the world, such as scouting. It is used to teach self-reliance and teamwork. Camping is also used as a inexpensive form of accommodation for people attending large open air events such as sporting meetings and music festivals. Organizers often provide a field and other basic amenities. Information on this page is from <a title="Wikipedia Camping" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camping">Wikipedia Camping</a></p>

		<p>Camping describes a <strong>range of activities</strong>. Survivalist campers set off with little more than their boots, whereas recreational vehicle travelers arrive equipped with their own electricity, heat, and patio furniture. Camping is often enjoyed in conjunction with activities, such as: <em>canoeing, climbing, fishing, hill walking, mountain biking, motorcycling, swimming, and whitewater kayaking</em>. Camping may also be combined with hiking, either as backpacking or as a series of day hikes from a central location.</p>
